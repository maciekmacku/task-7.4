            Break it dev


            Lik e "Oh  he's bro ke!! I told you he was broke!
            I told you he ain't got no money"
            Or you know this and that or whatever whatever
            Then you'll see some other people
            You'll put that you're here in this house
            "Oh Joey done made it!
            He bought a crib! He this, he that"
            So it's all a story. It's a perception
            That people make for you, along the way
            So it's not really what it necessarily
            Is at any point or given at time
            And that's the thing that concerns me

            First things first is I been rehearsing these verses
            In hopes that I hit the surface
            And keep myself afloat
            But I know one day
            I'm earning me some platinum and some gold
            And all them labels could just reimburse
            This dick in they throat
            And tell my mama "Oh no,"
            Your purses will never run low
            No more cause back
            When I was four, and we was poor
            You would purchase the store
            So here I go, your little man has got to grow
            I'm walking out the door
            My mama just be smiling cause she know
            I got my back, ain't gotta worry
            Only thing she ask is that I hurry
            Home in time for Christmas
            For some dinner (some dinner)
            "Seen you on TV again, boy you lookin' thinner
            But you lookin' like a winner", aye
